# WycieczkaRobotow
GUI based simulation engine for displaying movements of robot formation traveling through desired path

To run example simulation:
1. Open WycieczkaRobotow.pro with QtCreator and build it
2. Open ./FollowTheLeader_SimulationExample/FollowTheLeader_SimulationExample.pro and build it
3. Assure that the resultant file from step 2 (Simulation.exe) is in the same directory as the resultant
   file from step 1 (WycieczkaRobotow.exe). Copy the files if needed.
4. Copy the ./result/data directory to the directory containing the executable files mentioned above
5. - Run WycieczkaRobotow from the QtCreator, OR 
   - Place all the necessary .dll files in the directory together with executable files (.dll files may
     be found in ./result)

OR

1. Try to run already built WycieczkaRobotow.exe from ./result
